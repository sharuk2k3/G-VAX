                <h1>IMPORTANCE OF VACCINE</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Parents want to do everything possible to make sure their children are healthy and protected
                        from
                        preventable diseases. Vaccination is the best way to do that.</li>

                    <li>Vaccination protects children from serious illness and complications of vaccine-preventable
                        diseases
                        which can include amputation of an arm or leg, hospitalization, pneumonia, hearing loss,
                        convulsions,
                        brain damage, and death.</li>

                    <li>Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, whooping cough, and influenza are still a threat.
                        They
                        continue to infect U.S. children, resulting in hospitalizations and deaths every year.</li>

                    <li>Though vaccination has led to a dramatic decline in the number of U.S. cases of several
                        infectious
                        diseases, some, such as measles, are quite common in other countries and are brought to the U.S.
                        by
                        international travelers. If children are not vaccinated, they could easily get one of these
                        diseases
                        from a traveler or while traveling themselves.</li>

                    <li>Outbreaks of preventable diseases occur when many parents decide not to vaccinate their
                        children..
                    <li>Vaccination is safe and effective. All vaccines undergo long and careful review by scientists,
                        doctors,
                        and the federal government to make sure they are safe.</li>

                    <li>Organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family
                        Physicians,
                        and
                        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all strongly support protecting children with
                        recommended
                        vaccinations.</li>

                    <li>Vaccination protects others you care about, including family members, friends, and grandparents.
                    </li>

                    <li>If children aren’t vaccinated, they can spread disease to other children who are too young to be
                        vaccinated or to people with weakened immune systems, such as transplant recipients and people
                        with
                        cancer. This could result in long-term complications and even death for these vulnerable people.
                    </li>

                    <li>We all have a public health commitment to our communities to protect each other and each other’s
                        children by vaccinating our own family members.</li>
                    <h2>
                        <dt>What are vaccines?</dt>
                    </h2>
                    <dd>A vaccine (or immunization) is a way to build your body’s natural immunity to a disease before
                        you
                        get
                        sick. This keeps you from getting and spreading the disease.

                        For most vaccines, a weakened form of the disease germ is injected into your body. This is
                        usually
                        done
                        with a shot in the leg or arm. Your body detects the invading germs (antigens) and produces
                        antibodies
                        to fight them. Those antibodies then stay in your body for a long time. In many cases, they stay
                        for
                        the
                        rest of your life. If you’re ever exposed to the disease again, your body will fight it off
                        without
                        you
                        ever getting the disease.

                        Some illnesses, like strains of cold viruses, are fairly mild. But some, like smallpox or polio,
                        can
                        cause life-altering changes. They can even result in death. That’s why preventing your body from
                        contracting these illnesses is very important.</dd>
                    <h2>
                        <dt>How does immunity work?</dt>
                    </h2>
                    <dd>ur body builds a defense system to fight foreign germs that could make you sick or hurt you.
                        It’s
                        called
                        your immune system. To build up your immune system, your body must be exposed to different
                        germs.
                        When
                        your body is exposed to a germ for the first time, it produces antibodies to fight it. But that
                        takes
                        time and you usually get sick before the antibodies have built up. But once you have antibodies,
                        they
                        stay in your body. So the next time you’re exposed to that germ, the antibodies will attack it,
                        and
                        you
                        won’t get sick.</dd>
